- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jenny-PL
- 💡 I’m interested in making websites, challenging myself to try something totally new, strengthening my logic thinking skills, and experiencing a different type of work.
- 👍🏽 I work as an occupational therapist in a healthcare setting- currently rotating between acute care (hospital), inpatient rehab, and an outpatient clinic (neuro based).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, how to log-in to GitHub :) I think Python will be next. As well as finishing CS50!
- 🥂 I’d love to chat with others who have made a transtion from working as a healthcare clinician into tech and coding roles, and I'd love to meet other women in tech!
