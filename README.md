- 👋  Hi, I’m @Jenny-PL
- 💻  I'm a student at Ada Developer's Academy, learning full stack software development.  If you are a woman or gender-expansive person looking to get into software development, check them out!
- 👍🏽  My background is in occupational therapy (healthcare setting)- rotating between acute care (hospital), inpatient rehab, and an outpatient clinic (neuro based).
- 🥂  I’d love to chat with others who have made a transtion from working as a healthcare clinician into tech and coding roles, and I'd love to meet other women in tech!
