- 👋  Hi, I’m @Jenny-PL
- 💡  I’m interested learning to code, challenging myself to try something totally new, strengthening my logic thinking skills, and experiencing a different type of work.
- 👍🏽  I currently work as an occupational therapist in a healthcare setting- rotating between acute care (hospital), inpatient rehab, and an outpatient clinic (neuro based).
- 🌱  I have been learning some basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and how to log-in to GitHub :)
- 🥂  I’d love to chat with others who have made a transtion from working as a healthcare clinician into tech and coding roles, and I'd love to meet other women in tech!
- 💻  I'm applying to Ada Developer's Acadmey for their software developer program.  If you are a woman or gender-expansive person looking to get into software development, check them out!
